Today we've released new version of CodeHighlight extension. The main feature of this release is support of [Summernote 
WYSIWYG editor](http://summernote.org/){:target="_blank"}. This request was filed by one of our users. He had a problems with editing 
HTML source code in [OpenCart](https://www.opencart.com/){:target="_blank"} admin panel. 

OpenCart is one of the most popuplar E-commerce platforms. It takes over 15% of the total market share. Unlike the 
other competitors which use TinyMCE as the main text editor, OpenCart decided to use Summernote as the main editor.

## What Summernote Is
It worth to say a couple of words about Summernote. This WYSIWYG editor was designed to work with Bootstrap. The first 
version was released in Jun 30, 2013 by the team of developers from Seoul, Korea. Today Summernote can be easily 
integrated with the most popular frameworks like Django, Ruby on Rails, AngularJS and etc. May be it is not so popular
as the other competitors like TinyMCE, CKEditor and etc. But if you need to choose some WYSIWYG editor for your 
project, it definitely has sense to take a closer look at Summernote. And yes, it is completely FREE.
